# Codenames Duet - Keygen
 Python Script to print the key cards for the boardgame Codenames Duet. Default: 10 copies for each side. 
 
 
## How to use
 Run the script, and two folders will be generated: A and B.
 To play a game, each team has to get the file with the same number as the other team.
 (Example, A uses 8A and B uses 8B)
